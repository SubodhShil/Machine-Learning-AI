Bob Dylan's 2016 Nobel Prize Banquet Speech - Full Speech Transcript
Good evening, everyone. I extend my warmest greetings to the members of the Swedish Academy and to all of the other distinguished guests in attendance tonight.
I’m sorry I can’t be with you in person, but please know that I am most definitely with you in spirit and honored to be receiving such a prestigious prize. Being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature is something I never could have imagined or seen coming. From an early age, I’ve been familiar with and reading and absorbing the works of those who were deemed worthy of such a distinction: Kipling, Shaw, Thomas Mann, Pearl Buck, Albert Camus, Hemingway. These giants of literature whose works are taught in the schoolroom, housed in libraries around the world and spoken of in reverent tones have always made a deep impression. That I now join the names on such a list is truly beyond words.
I don’t know if these men and women ever thought of the Nobel honor for themselves, but I suppose that anyone writing a book, or a poem, or a play anywhere in the world might harbor that secret dream deep down inside. It’s probably buried so deep that they don’t even know it’s there.
If someone had ever told me that I had the slightest chance of winning the Nobel Prize, I would have to think that I’d have about the same odds as standing on the moon. In fact, during the year I was born and for a few years after, there wasn’t anyone in the world who was considered good enough to win this Nobel Prize. So, I recognize that I am in very rare company, to say the least.
I was out on the road when I received this surprising news, and it took me more than a few minutes to properly process it. I began to think about William Shakespeare, the great literary figure. I would reckon he thought of himself as a dramatist. The thought that he was writing literature couldn’t have entered his head. His words were written for the stage. Meant to be spoken not read. When he was writing Hamlet, I’m sure he was thinking about a lot of different things: “Who’re the right actors for these roles?” “How should this be staged?” “Do I really want to set this in Denmark?” His creative vision and ambitions were no doubt at the forefront of his mind, but there were also more mundane matters to consider and deal with. “Is the financing in place?” “Are there enough good seats for my patrons?” “Where am I going to get a human skull?” I would bet that the farthest thing from Shakespeare’s mind was the question “Is this literature?”
When I started writing songs as a teenager, and even as I started to achieve some renown for my abilities, my aspirations for these songs only went so far. I thought they could be heard in coffee houses or bars, maybe later in places like Carnegie Hall, the London Palladium. If I was really dreaming big, maybe I could imagine getting to make a record and then hearing my songs on the radio. That was really the big prize in my mind. Making records and hearing your songs on the radio meant that you were reaching a big audience and that you might get to keep doing what you had set out to do.
Well, I’ve been doing what I set out to do for a long time, now. I’ve made dozens of records and played thousands of concerts all around the world. But it’s my songs that are at the vital center of almost everything I do. They seemed to have found a place in the lives of many people throughout many different cultures and I’m grateful for that.
But there’s one thing I must say. As a performer I’ve played for 50,000 people and I’ve played for 50 people and I can tell you that it is harder to play for 50 people. 50,000 people have a singular persona, not so with 50. Each person has an individual, separate identity, a world unto themselves. They can perceive things more clearly. Your honesty and how it relates to the depth of your talent is tried. The fact that the Nobel committee is so small is not lost on me.
But, like Shakespeare, I too am often occupied with the pursuit of my creative endeavors and dealing with all aspects of life’s mundane matters. “Who are the best musicians for these songs?” “Am I recording in the right studio?” “Is this song in the right key?” Some things never change, even in 400 years.
Not once have I ever had the time to ask myself, “Are my songs literature?”
So, I do thank the Swedish Academy, both for taking the time to consider that very question, and, ultimately, for providing such a wonderful answer.
My best wishes to you all,
Bob Dylan

91-year-old former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien - Full Speech Transcript - March 9, 2025
Canada is trending!
Sitting in Toronto I find myself reading stories about how ​Canadians are cancelling US vacations​, protesting Elon's "Canada isn't a real country" comments by ​scratching up Teslas​, and swerving buying dollars to ​local Canadian goods​.
I love Canada! I've written about Canada a lot. It was ​#10 on 1000 Awesome Things​ and I expanded that little essay into a ​long-form Audible Original​ and now I'm working to expand it again into (maybe!) a print book. 
I love Canada! We love Canada. It's where I'm from, where I grew up, where I live. Canada is most certainly home. 
It's in that context Leslie and I were brought to tears many times a few weeks ago when 91-year-old (!) former Canadian Prime Minister (1993 to 2003) Jean Chrétien gave this thundering speech at the Liberal convention in Ottawa as Justin Trudeau and the ​Liberal Party of Canada​ passed the baton to the brilliant ​Mark Carney​.  
There is so much here! How Canadians and Americans are friends—and always have been, despite one guy musing that we're not, how Canada is the place most people would want to restart their lives, how Canadians have fought off American imperial ambitions before with a polite yet firm "Non, merci." And much, much more. How powerful to see an elder diplomat elevate the level of the conversation rather than fall to lowest common denominator of algorithmically-infused soundbite discourse.
Here is the full transcript of Jean Chrétien's speech.
Vive le Canada!
Neil 
(Speaking in French) 
"Prime Minister Trudeau, Candidates, Candidates, President of the party, Ministers and MPs, dear compatriots ... good evening.
This is an exceptional opportunity for me to be here this evening. 
This is my ninth Liberal convention that I’ve participated in (applause) and it’s the seventh time I’ve spoken at the podium.  I would have never thought that I could do it at ninety-one! (huge applause) 
I am still ready to fight! I have fight in me yet. 
(switches to English)
It’s great to see so many young people in the room today. It reminds me of my first Liberal convention when I was the President of the Young Liberals at Laval University (applause) ... in 1958 (gasps) ... when ​Lester Pearson​ was elected Liberal leader.
(cheers)
In 1958 ... (laughs) ... not many of you were born! (laughs)
And he then became a very good Prime Minister.
I have kept coming to Liberal convention for sixty-eight years.
I have kept coming back to Liberal convention because of what the Liberal Party stand for.
I have kept coming back because of what the Liberal Party has delivered to make the lives of Canadians better.
And I am here today because it is the Liberal Party that can best deliver the better lives for Canadians in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead. 
(applause) 
It is the Liberal Party that has given Canadian the ​Canadian Pension Plan​ and ​Medicare​ (applause), the ​Charter of Rights and Freedom​ (applause), the ​two official languages​ (applause),  that put the ​indigenous rights into the Canadian constitution​ (applause), brought in ​tough gun control laws​ (applause), ​affirmative action​ (applause). We have always supported ​women's right to choose​ (huge applause), we are the party who led the way to permit—the second country in the world to ​permit same-sex marriage​.
The party is the party of diversity, equality, tolerance, openness, and inclusiveness.
(applause)
We Liberals call it the very essence of Canada, and it is the Liberal Party that gave us the ​red maple leaf flag​ (applause), sixty years ago, which flew so proudly in homes across the country on the 14th of February to demonstrate our patriotism and love for Canada.
I want to say a special thank you to former Prime Ministers ​Joe Clark​, (Stephen) ​Harper​, (Paul) ​Martin​, (Kim) ​Campbell​, for coming together with me to rally Canadian across the land to show the Canadian flag with pride ... with a lot of pride.
(huge standing applause)  
But tonight I want to pay tribute to Justin Trudeau.
(applause)
I want to pay tribute to him for taking the Liberal Party from third place to government (applause) and to ​three successive election victories​. I want to pay tribute to what he and his team have accomplish: ​Canadian Child Benefit​ (applause) to reduce the poverty for the children in Canada, the ​ten dollars childcare​ (applause) that opened the labour market to so many women, for the ​dental plan for low-income Canadians​ (applause), for all the ​work he’s done on the environment​.
(applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, these are Liberal policies.
And let’s talk about the economic reality of the moment now because Canada has done well. This—I’m telling you (applause), as I’ve said sooo many times—Canada is not broken.
(huge applause)
Despite the attacks by the critics, Canada has the lowest deficit per capita in the ​G7​ (applause), more than five times lower than in the United States.
(applause)
For the lowest debt per capita in the G7.
(applause)
And, in fact, the payment on the interest of the debt today is only 11% for each dollar of tax we pay and compared to what we got when we formed the government in 1993, we were obliged to pay thirty-five cents (35%) in every tax dollar.
That was a little problem the Tories left to me.
(laughter)
And we balanced the books!
We took that mess from the Tories and we balanced the books!
And we had ten years of surplus.
And the Tories came back to power, and we went back in debt.
(laughter)
Now inflation is 1.9% percent in Canada. It’s 3.2% and increasing south of the border ... you know?
(laughter)
I spent my life talking about job creation. Now the problem, we’re looking for manpower. It’s a difficult problem, but it’s better than reverse.
You know, I want to pay tribute to the government, to Mr. Trudeau, and to all the provincial governments, for the fact that they have, with the municipalities, they have put together the best program on the pandemic that we faced, better than any other country in the world.
(applause)
Our death rate was less than half of the United States.
Today, as a party, we’re choosing a new leader. A leader who will assume the mantle of (Wilfred) ​Laurier​ and (Louis) ​St. Laurent​ and (Lester B.) ​Pearson​, ​Trudeau’s father​, ... ​Trudeau ... the son​, who has with him a very beautiful daughter. You know, I’m old enough to say that.
(laughs)
And myself. And I want—that is very important—I want to take this moment to say I am impress, I am, by the quality of the candidates whose names are on the ballot tonight!
(applause) 
It makes me very, very proud to be a Liberal.
(switches to French)
And now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room.
The long and fruitful friendship with Americans built over decades, which is falling apart before our eyes, and is becoming something which is difficult to name.
Mutual respect, trust, reciprocal cooperation, friendship, which have long characterized our relationship are now giving way to wariness and more and more open hostility from the Trump administration towards our country.
This is—this is something we’ve never seen. But this is something that Canadians don’t understand, and I think the majority of Americans don’t understand it either, without mentioning the rest of the planet.
Why?
Well, why, historians, journalists, and university researchers and experts at international politics are trying to make sense of something that doesn’t make sense.
Well, in Canada, our elbows are up. We’re working together to unite to deal with this threat—the threat to our economy and our sovereignty. In other words, our very existence as a country. 
(applause)
At the beginning of the week, tariffs became a reality. And there will only be losers if you measure it in financial terms alone. But for Canadians, it’s more than that. It’s more than money that’s at stake here. We love our country and our independence. We love who we are because we’re unique in the world.
(switches to English)
And I want to pay tribute to the Trudeau government and all the Premiers for the way they have led Canada in the last few weeks in confronting the menace imposed on us...
(long applause)
...with tariff completely unjustified. Governments have absolutely right in retaliating as they are, and I congratulate all of them.
If it is necessary, the governments altogether can consider going further: and hitting the Americans where it's really hurts, by imposing an export tax on oil, gas, potash, steel, aluminum, and electricity.
(applause)
And we’ll use that money to build infrastructure that are needed in Canada. For example, to build a pipeline for natural gas from Alberta to Quebec. Alberta, the family of my mother, and Quebec ... of my father.
So, you know, I think that if we do that, that will keep the steelworkers working in Canada for a long time.
(laughs, applause)
And I could go on and on, but I’m limited in time. So the world has lived for eighty years with a rule-based order that has brought us peace and prosperity. It has enabled the United States to be the strongest, the most powerful country in the world. It has allowed all of us to sleep well every night.
And now Donald Trump has decided to throw it all out the window.
We are going to be living very difficult times, but I’m confident, I’m very confident that the next Prime Minister will work with the Premiers, the leaders of all the political parties in the House of Commons, and allies around the world to stand together to meet the challenges that Mr. Trump is creating for the whole world. 
(applause)
And perhaps, speaking of the President, it is time for little history lesson for him.
(laughs)
Probably he does not realize that in 1776 ​Benjamin Franklin spent a year in Montreal trying to convince the people to join the American Revolution​. And he was tollld by the Francophone, 'Non, merci.'
(cheers)
And they were right. Look what happened to the ​French language in Louisiana​.
The loyalists left the USA to come back to Upper Canada and the Atlantic, and the Francophone of Lower Canada, together they built our independent country.
During the ​War of 1812​, Americans who came to what is now Canada on a mission of conquest. They were defeated by ​Colonel de Salaberry​ in what is now ​Quebec​ and by leaders like the great indigenous chief ​Tecumseh​, in what is now ​Ontario​. 
(applause)
And I don’t know apparently some ​burned the White House​ at that time. 
But I’m too old to do it. No, it’s a joke.
(laughter)
But, ladies and gentlemen, we have been friend and good neighbour with our southern neighbours. But we must stand up for ourselves. Historically, despite our friendship, we have had problems, but we always found a way to solve them.
We have worked with and collaborated with the United States in the past, and I’m telling you, we will do so in the future.
(applause)
We are good neighbours and friends, but we are proud and independent country.
(cheers)
But sometimes one must stand up for Canada. We must always be vigilant, and I did so as Minister and as Prime Minister.
Way back in 1968, when the Americans sent a ship, the ​Manhattan​, with no Canadian flag through our ​northern passage​, they wanted to prove that the passage was international water. As Minister of Northern Affairs, I flew to ​Pond Inlet​ at the northern extremity of ​Baffin Island​ to confront them. I was on the ​Louis St. Laurent​ icebreaker. I call the captain. I said, 'I will be there in an hour (laughter)... and it’s better to have the Canadian flag at the mast.'
(long applause)
When I arrived, there was a Canadian flag at the mast.
(cheers)
And I had a big smile.
(laughs)
You know, we had other problems of the same nature. You remember Newfoundland, the so-called ​Fish War​, when we arrested the (Spanish fishing trawler) Estai, when my friend (former Newfoundland Premier Brian) ​Tobin​ made a great show at the UN with the illegal nets. And—we were successful. They changed the international laws after that because there was a problem that needed to be fix.
And I’m quite proud of it ... and it was quite a time.
(cheers)
I was travelling in the west. I came back. It was early week. So it was a Thursday, early week. So my wife said, 'We’ll have a good rest for the weekend.' And I said, 'Perhaps not, because I’m declaring war to Spain.'
(laughter)
She did not sleep.
(laughter)
But, you know, we had another problem on the West Coast. You know, we have ​Vancouver Island​, the mainland, and Canadian waters. And the fishermen from Oregon and Washington State were going to Alaska, but they were not respecting our water. So we threatened them to block the passage on Canadian water and force them to go in the high seas. It was a very difficult problem. The ​Senator Velasquez​ said it was almost a question of war.
So I discussed that, and I talked with my friend ​Bill Clinton​, and he said 'It's out of Canada, there’s not much I can do.' And I said 'If you cannot do something, I will do something.' And they were forced to respect our laws. Some were taken to courts. And after that the problem was solved because we stood for us strongly. 
(cheering)
But for eight years, I was a colleague of Bill Clinton, and he would always say that Canada was his best ally. And that I was a very good friend, and we still are very good friends. But we work together. And we found solution together. And this is what will happen in the future, too. We always been good neighbours with anybody.
So I was proud too when I was Prime Minister and ​I had to say 'No' to the participation in the American invasion of Iraq​.
(long, sustained cheering)
That decision told the United States and the world that Canada is a proud, independent country.
(cheering)
Of course, the business community was very nervous. They were afraid of retaliation. So I told them, 'Okayyy. Give me the list of all the goods, and all the services, that the Americans are buying from us because they like us.'
I have not received the list yet.
(laughs)
So, you know we will work in collaboration with them, but, you know, they have to understand, and everybody understand that we are a very proud country. And ... for me, I can tell you that sometimes I can say this. From one old guy to another old guy...
(laughs)
Stop this nonsense!
(long, loud cheers)
Canada will never join the United States!
I can tell you that my parents were not ​millionaires from New York​. They were ​worker from Shawinigan​.
(cheers)
But my mother taught us good manners.
She would have been ashaaaame of me if I had treated anyone the way that the President treated my Prime Minister and the President in Ukraine in the last few weeks.
(cheering)
The reason we don’t want to become American is because of our values as Canadians. We are proud Canadians, and, yes, in fact we owe a debt of recognitions to Mr. Trump. He has united us as never before!
(cheering)
So I want to say thank you to him, and I think I will propose him for the ​Order of Canada​. 
(laughs) 
I’m just kidding.
(switches to French) 
Prime Minister, I will travel across the world. I went to the UN, to the G7, to NATO, to the Commonwealth, to the Francophonie, and to all sorts of international meetings on the five continents. When I came back to Canada, each time I would say that the job of being Prime Minister is perhaps the easiest of any country in the world. Canada is the country that works the best, I think, much better than any other country in the world.
(switches to English) 
And it’s why there are millions and millions of human beings from all over the world who would like to come and become Canadian citizens.
There was a survey not long ago. They were asking the people, 'Where would you want to go if you had to start again your life?' And Canada was number one.
(cheers) 
Why?
It’s because Canada is the land of freedom.
Canada is the land of opportunity (cheers), the land of generosity (cheers), the land of tolerance (cheers), the land of stability (cheers), the land of rule of law.
(cheers)
It is our land that is the envy of the world.
Canada will continue to rise—true north strong and free.
(cheers)
Nobody will starrrrve us into submission ... because Canada is ... and will remain ... the best country in the world.
(giant fist pump)
Vive le Canada!!!" 
(long standing ovation)
